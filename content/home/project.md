- [**Framework to Guide Designing of Interactive Tools for Art Galleries (Master Thesis)**]({{< ref "/project/thesis/index.md" >}})

The thesis proposes a framework which will help in designing and building of interactive tools for art galleries. The research started with the background analysis of all the factors that influence the planning of an exhibit/show at an art gallery. One to-one interviews were conducted with the art curators from different art galleries in Nova Scotia, Canada. The Maud Lewis exhibit (present at Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Halifax) has been used to test the framework.

- [**Heart Disease Prediction Using Data Mining Techniques**]({{< ref "/project/heart/index.md" >}})

Heart disease is increasing day by day in today's world due to lifestyle, heredity. In this project, decision tree classifiers as well as a probability based classifier. The algorithms that we will be using are (i) Na√Øve Bayes classifier (ii) J48 algorithm (iii) Random forest classifier. We will be using an existing patient dataset of Cleveland from UCI repository to test and analyze the algorithms. Experiments result have been found to reach an accuracy up to 59%.
