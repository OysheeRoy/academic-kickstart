abstract: "The thesis proposes a framework which will help in designing and building of interactive tools for art galleries. The research started with the background analysis of all the factors that influence the planning of an exhibit/show at an art gallery. One to-one interviews were conducted with the art curators from different art galleries in Nova Scotia, Canada. The data collected from the interview were qualitative. Thematic analysis has been done on the collected data to find out factors or features that should be considered while building an interactive tool. These factors were grouped to form modules which eventually was used to design the framework. The Maud Lewis exhibit (present at Art Gallery of Nova Scotia, Halifax) has been used as a reference. Different solutions for the Maude Lewis exhibit have been suggested based on the data analysis and the framework."
