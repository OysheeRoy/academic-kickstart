abstract: "Reducing the energy consumption of available resources is still a problem to be solved in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Many types of existing routing protocols are developed to save power consumption. In these protocols, cluster-based routing protocols are found to be more energy efficient. A cluster head is selected to aggregate the data received from root nodes and forwards these data to the base station in cluster-based routing. The selection of cluster heads should be efficient to save energy. In our proposed protocol, we use static clustering for the efficient selection of cluster heads. The proposed routing protocol works efficiently in large as well as small areas. For an optimal number of cluster head selection we divide a large sensor field into rectangular clusters. Then these rectangular clusters are further grouped into zones for efficient communication between cluster heads and a base station. We perform MATLAB simulations to observe the network stability, throughput, energy consumption, network lifetime and the number of cluster heads. Our proposed routing protocol outperforms in large areas in comparison with the LEACH, MH-LEACH, and SEP routing protocols."
