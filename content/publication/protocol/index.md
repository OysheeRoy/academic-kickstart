abstract: Involvement of hypermedia in art galleries and visitors engagement is truly an interdisciplinary research. We propose an initial study which will help in the building of a framework to design a satisfying interactive and engaging tools for visitors to art galleries. The paper suggests conducting semi-structured interviews with art curators as stakeholders. Thematic analysis should be done on the collected data which will help us to focus on the specific factors of greatest import to guide design of the tool set. The collected information and lessons from existing hypermedia models will continue to guide the designing of suitable tools.
